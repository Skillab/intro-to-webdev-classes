# Session 5
## Facilitator’s Guide
### Programming for APIs – calls and effect, the web is a program.

Welcome back everyone!

The challenge for this lab is to create a Transport Mapper!

+ Start by opening the Class5.html file in your Examples and Templates folder.

+ Familiarize yourself with the page’s files and locate for the myFunction function.

+ Adapt this function to read the center of your map.

Google maps move around, so the center might not be where it loads from.

Discover how to ask about places near to your location form the Places API.
