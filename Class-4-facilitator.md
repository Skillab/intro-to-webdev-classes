# Session ‘4’
## Facilitator’s Guide :
### Programming for Users – inputs, outputs, events and effects.

Welcome back everyone!

The challenge for this lab is to create cocktails! We will build a web app to create recipes and instructions for mixing and preparing or playing with cocktails.

You will build an HTML, CSS and JavaScript Cocktail App. You may add graphics and images, form inputs, dialogs and alerts, or other HTML parts, whatever you choose. You can write a recipe generator or a recipe book, a drink mixing game or guide. You should plan and prepare something both you and your mentor think is within reach for the night.


The programming tools you have developed will allow you manipulate web page parts of HTML and CSS. The Class Materials folder for Session 4 contains five html, five JavaScript and five css files. They are a series of hints and examples you might use to build your app. Take a look at these and quiz your mentors about how they work. Most of the parts will look familiar now, but ask about any which look new.

As you saw in the homework, HTML and CSS can make websites contain images and text and can give pages structure by ordering the elements in the browser window. Your JavaScript skills can be used to read and write parts of these pages. They will allow you to change pages and add or remove parts from them. You can combine these techniques and use your JavaScript skills to describe behaviors and add logic to pages, and create full blown applications.


There will be no instructor lead examples tonight, these samples and a short talk on the HTML and CSS skills from last week's homework will be all the direction you'll receive/need. Talk with your mentors [namechecks] Make sure you and your mentor understand the steps you intend to take to reach your goal.

Tonight, aim to work in three principle parts: think, plan & build. We will make a break at ..... and begin building in earnest once we come back.
