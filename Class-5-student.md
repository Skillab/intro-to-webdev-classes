# Session ‘5’
## Student Guide
### Programming for APIs – calls and effect, the web is a program.

Welcome back everyone!

Tonight you will program a Transport Mapper using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

+ Start by opening the Class5.html file in your Examples and Templates folder.

+ Once you can see the map and have read the page notes, take a look at Google’s [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).
Modify the parameters to create a map located on Google Campus and scaled to also show The Barbican.
*Hint, you’ll need to find the Latitude and Longitude for this room; it’s roughly 51.522651 by -0.085643*
Make any changes you like to your page: increase the map size or recolour the background, you may use any of the css and html tricks you’ve learnt.

+ Once you have a page you like use the guide at Google’s API Server to give the correct functionality to myFunction();

Now show that however you drag the map surface around you can always get the center Lat Lon value (latitude and longitude) from your code and alert it.

+ Look at the Google Places API and discover how to ask about places near to LatLon values taken from a map. You can add some of these items to your map if you wish.

HTML is for page scaffolding.
CSS is for look, feel and style.
JavaScript is for the logic and behavior of the moving parts.

Discuss the plan with your mentor and be confident that you and your mentor understand the plan before you attempt to implement it.

Remember: Think, Plan *& then* Build.
Have fun!
