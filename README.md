intro-to-webdev-classes
=======================

Classes for the Introduction to Web Development 6 week course - the first Skillab offering.


## Welcome to Skillab Open Source

Hello and welcome. Here you will find the tried and tested flipped-classroom materials of Skillab. We hope that you download them, use them, modify and experiment with them, and send us a pull-request with all your new found learning.
Skillab wants to help every adult become conversational in code. How we achieve that and how this repository of classes and guides makes that happen is up to us all - glad to have you join in!


## The Source Materials

What we mean by the source in Skillab Open Source is 'source material' - anything that might be required by you to run a Skillab at your location. These sources will remain freely available, free to be modified and free to use. We only ask that if you redistribute or include the materials in projects of your own that you clearly present this repo as their origin. That's the open bit ;-)




## What's in this repo?

We understand that you may be new to GitHub, and to version control and the open source repository idea in general - don't worry! You may browse this site as you would any other website, and will be able to view and inspect each file of the source materials. If you wish to download the materials for later use, click on the Download ZIP button, over there -> just to the right.
You can leave the repo, hub, fork and versions things for later - there are some guides and we will be making one available on our http://www.skillab.co.uk site soon too. 



## How do I use the Markdown?

Some of the source materials are Markdown files. You can identify them from the ',md' file extension at the end of their name. Markdown is a plain text file format with a few, key styling characters. It is easy to read and to write, lightweight and can be converted easily.
We have some Markdown tips here: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
and a tool to render them to pdf here: [https://www.npmjs.org/package/markdown-pdf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/markdown-pdf) and here: [http://www.markdowntopdf.com](http://www.markdowntopdf.com)

The rest of the materials are either images, text, html or css, or javascript files - some of these you may know, some may be new to you but the instructions and the guidance will be in Markdown (.md).



## How do I use these materials?

The Â£M question... However you wish! If you would like to run Skillabs along the model we started in London last year, you should start with the first class Class 1 and by reading the Facilitator's Guide.
Browse our [http://www.skillab.co.uk](http://www.skillab.co.uk) site for other Skillab class ideas or connect with our events, meetups and other Skillab users through our blog.
