# Session ‘2’
## Introduction to JavaScript – numbers, strings, operators and expressions.


### Introduction:
Welcome everyone back. Discuss the first homework. Assess any incomplete examples. Take any outstanding book orders.


### Talk:
What do we need to describe our Algorithms and Models to computers? What’s in a programming language? What are Variables, Arrays, Operators and Expressions. We will introduce the worksheets for the exercises below and state the goals for the night; Modelling.


Mentors will help to open and demonstrate how to edit our example code exercises and show how to use Chrome to test them.


### Exercises:
We will split into pairs, one mentor each.

*Values and Variables 1*  Assignment: what happens to variables assigned values?
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Operators and Expressions 1*  Manipulation: how do you do basic math with variables?
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Operators and Expressions 2*  The Poverty Line Expression – can you tell who is below the poverty line?
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Values and Variables 2*  The Amsterdam Array – which travel strategy is cheapest?
Mentors will assist pairs.


In summary we see that a programming language has rich and capable means to use in describing things for a computer Model.


Finally we introduce the homework.
