# Session ‘3’
## Advancing JavaScript – reusing & repeating, making statements and decisions.


### Introduction:
Welcome everyone back. Discuss the second homework. Assess any incomplete examples. Hand out book orders.

### Talk:
Writing and Invoking Functions. The logical operators, why we have them and what they can do. How we use sequence or order when we do things and why we sometimes do things twice (or more than twice..!). We will explain how the use of Functions can help make programs more organised and more easily maintainable.


Mentors will start to sit with their pairs as the class session starts to write examples for the following exercises. We will all develop the first two together, then break and talk before the last two.


### Exercises:
We will split into pairs, one mentor each.

*Functions 1* Writing a function to count to ten, and invoke it.
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Functions 2*  Writing a function to accept some inputs, and invoke it.
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Decisions 1*  Writing a function which can compare two numbers.
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Decisions 2*  Writing a function which can ‘recognise’ common pets.
Mentors will assist pairs.

We will break at this point and then introduce Iteration.

*Iteration 1*  Extending our pet program to list our pets, and make them speak!
Mentors will assist pairs.


### Challenge:
The challenge is to present a solution to the AI Number Guessing Game where the computer is made intelligent enough to guess a number between 1 and 100 chosen by a student when given higher or lower prompts to incorrect ‘guesses’ You must make a program smart enough to get any answer within 6 ‘guesses’ or less!.
Mentors will assist pairs.


In summary we see that code we write can be re-used by our programs. We can use it repeatedly and in any order we wish to. We can also recycle it and lessen the complexity of other code or shorten our programs.


We will review the homework. For, While, Control exercises in JavaScript Track, if time allows.
