# Session 1
## Introduction to Programming: programming principles.


### Introduction:
Welcome everyone. Discuss the course plan. Make introductions. Meet students.


### Talk:
What are programs?


### Exercises:
We will split into pairs, one mentor each.

*Instructions 1* can you tell what these out of order lists might be programs for?
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Instructions 2* how fully do you need to describe processes for a program?
Mentors will assist pairs.

*Instructions 3* how might your program go wrong? can we accommodate some errors?
Mentors will assist pairs.


In summary we see that a description of a process for a computer is a very specific thing. It has specific needs and peculiar behaviour. We call descriptions of this process an Algorithm. Correspondingly the description of things for a computer we call a Model.


We will next make a more informed demo of the Chrome web browser for debugging.

Mentors will help with registration at Codecademy.com.

Mentors will help with installation of text editors and code examples.

Finally we introduce the homework.
