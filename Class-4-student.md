# Session ‘4’
## Student Guide
### Programming for Users –inputs, outputs, events and effects.

Welcome back everyone!

Tonight you will program a Cocktail maker using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


You may build any kind of cocktail app, the class materials folder contains parts to get you going. You may add graphics and images, form inputs, dialogs or alerts, whatever you choose. You may write a recipe generator or a recipe book. It’s entirely up to you
But try to break the program you plan into logical parts. It will help to give your solution structure for the functions you’ll write.

### Quick recap from homework:

+ HTML is for page scaffolding.
+ CSS is for look, feel and style.
+ JavaScript is for the logic and behavior of the moving parts.

Discuss the plan with your mentor and be confident that you and your mentor understand the plan before you attempt to implement it.

Stick to your plan and try to get things working. Ask your mentor or class colleagues whenever you feel lost; sooner the better usually works best!

During this lab we will engage your skills with variables and functions from earlier in the course and in the second half introduce you to the JavaScript frameworks jQuery and jQuery UI.

Remember: Think, Plan *& then* Build.

Have fun!
