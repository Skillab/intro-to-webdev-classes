# Homework 5
## No More Coding!

There are no more Codecademy exercises required prior to class. For homework this week you will write a project brief to develop Planning & Design skills.

You are a rickshaw driver and you want to find out how people rate your driving and the journeys you take them on. You want a web application that will help you market your services and provide people with a way of giving feedback on their journey. You think it might be nice if they could put a pointer on a map for their journey, and then rate and comment on it.

+ Develop the brief for a developer.
+ Specify all the features your web app will need.
+ You should specify the way the features behave and the types of input and output they should give.

If you can demo this functionality with some JavaScript of your own, you might bring that along too but your goal is to develop a written brief. It will need to be read by someone else. You may need to consider providing details for things you app might need that you do not know how to do. This might be quite a significant part of the brief; unknowns/tbds.
