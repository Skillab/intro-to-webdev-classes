# Session 4
## Mentor’s Guide
### Programming for Users –inputs, outputs, events and effects.

Welcome back! In this lab the students are being challenged to build a Cocktail Maker web app. We will help them to use HTML and CSS along with their JavaScript skills to create graphics, images, form inputs, dialogs, alerts and manipulate them with jQuery.

Examples for all these techniques are included in the Class Materials folder.

We shall split the session into two parts: thinking and planning, and development and coding.


### First Part : Thinking and Planning


* Try to focus your students towards planning in logical parts. It will help to give your students structure for the functions they will write in their solution.

* Try to direct your students towards implementing something simple at first, base the core of their solution firmly on either example 3 or 4.

* The goal is to write and make code work, not innovate solutions. Help to break their goals into a sequence of milestones. If you can, mention only one at a time so as not to overwhelm them.


### Second Part : Coding

A set of hints and examples similar to Cookbook listings will be in the Class Materials folder. Example five will be a listing of tricks and should be looked at to gage complexity for the project. Direct students to using the clipart samples first, and finding resources online only after they have something working. You may not get even close to a working demonstration all night, so try to have had some working code written, or make a demonstration of linking styles to tags and accessing tags by their ids.

During this lab we will ONLY use CLASS for CSS selection, NEVER ID.
Id will be reserved for jQuery selection eg: `$('#thisthinghere')`
KISS!
