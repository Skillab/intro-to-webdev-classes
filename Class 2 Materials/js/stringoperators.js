 * Just to note, that 'adding strings together' isn't the same as adding numbers!
 * It explains why there are different types of data, because they need to behave
 * in different ways.
 * Adding strings to other strings to make longer strings is called 'concatenation'.
 * We have used it a few times now.
 * Modify this file to substract a string from a string, if you can :)
